# Developemnt of a Hololens application to mitigate movements effects from Parkinson's disease.

This is my thesis that was developed under the supervision of SPTBU AUTH.
### Tested on :
* Unity 2018.4 LTS
* Windows Holographic OS version 1809
* Windows 10 SDK 17763

### Tips- Info
* Just import to Unity and build
* Code from Microsoft HoloToolkit is being used and included in this project / repo. No need to import anything else.
* Graphical assets (free) downloaded from Unity Store and HoloToolkit.
* Holotoolkit uses prebuilt binaries. So only .NET backend in Unity will work. If you want IL2CPP switch to Mixed Reality Toolkit.
* For better perfomance build with Master option, both in Unity and Visual Studio. Use Debug build option only for debugging purposes.
* Last Unity release with .NET script backend support will be 2018.4 LTS.
